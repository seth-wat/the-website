### Personal Website - React

The goal behind this project was to use very few libraries and
write out the vast majority from scratch.


 * Hand rolled design with vanilla CSS.
    * *Toasts powered by [react-toastify](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify)*
 * Contact form for inquiries.
    * Powered by the serverless API I built [here](https://github.com/seth-wat/the-website-backend).
    * Custom validation and error handling with hooks.
