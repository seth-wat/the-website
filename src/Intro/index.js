        Being a developer is about more than being a coder.{" "}
        <Typist.Delay ms={500} /> Itâ€™s about being a unique problem solver,{" "}
        <Typist.Delay ms={500} /> an excellent communicator,{" "}
        <Typist.Delay ms={500} />
        and a translator between the complexities of software engineering and
        the user experience.

        Blending these traits into highly stable, <Typist.Delay ms={500} />
        deployable, <Typist.Delay ms={500} />
        and maintainable software is what it takes,
        <Typist.Delay ms={500} /> and what I enjoy.
